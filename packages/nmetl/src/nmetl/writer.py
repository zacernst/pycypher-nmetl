Writer Module (writer.py)
==========================

The ``writer.py`` module in the `pycypher` library provides a set of tools for writing tabular data to various file formats. It defines a flexible and extensible system for handling the output of data from the `pycypher` ETL pipeline.

Core Concepts
-------------

*   **Tabular Data:** The module is designed to handle data that can be represented in a table-like structure (rows and columns), where each row is a collection of data and the columns are attributes.
*   **Data Destinations:** The module supports writing data to different destinations, such as local files with varying formats.
*   **Extensibility:** The design is extensible, allowing you to add support for new file types or output destinations by creating new classes that adhere to the established interfaces.

Key Components
--------------

1.  **``TableWriter`` (Abstract Base Class):**

    *   **Purpose:** This is the abstract base class that defines the common interface for all table writers. It outlines the basic methods and properties that all concrete table writer classes must implement.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Defines a standard way to initialize a writer with a target URI.
        *   Specifies an abstract ``write`` method that subclasses must implement to handle the actual writing of data.
        *   Provides methods for easily retrieving the ``path`` and ``extension`` from the target URI.
        *   Provides a ``write_entity_table`` method to easily output the table of facts for a single node label.
        *   Contains a ``get_writer`` class method to create the correct subclass based on the file type specified.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   ``__init__(self, target_uri: str, **kwargs)``: Initializes the writer with the target URI and any additional keyword arguments.
        *   ``write(self, generator, entity: Optional[str] = None, session: Optional[Session] = None, **kwargs)``: An abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to write data from a generator to the specified target.
        *   ``path(self) -> str``: A property that returns the file path from the target URI.
        *   ``extension(self)``: A property that returns the file extension from the target URI.
        * `write_entity_table(self, session: Session, entity: str)`: write out all the rows for a particular entity type.
        * `get_writer(cls, uri: str) -> TableWriter`: return the correct sub class based on the uri.
        * ``__repr__(self) -> str``: Returns a string representation of the `TableWriter` object.
        *

2.  **``ParquetTableWriter`` (Concrete Implementation):**

    *   **Purpose:** A concrete implementation of ``TableWriter`` that writes data to Parquet files.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Implements the ``write`` method to handle the specifics of writing tabular data to Parquet format using the ``pyarrow`` library.
        *   Takes a generator that yields rows of data as dictionaries.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   ``write(self, generator, entity: str = None, session: Session = None, **kwargs)``: Writes data to a Parquet file.

3.  **``CSVTableWriter`` (Concrete Implementation):**

    *   **Purpose:** A concrete implementation of ``TableWriter`` that writes data to CSV files.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Implements the ``write`` method to handle the specifics of writing tabular data to CSV format using the built-in ``csv`` module.
        * Takes a generator that yields rows of data as dictionaries.
    *   **Key Methods:**
        *   ``write(self, generator, entity: Optional[str] = None, session: Optional[Session] = None, **kwargs)``: Writes data to a CSV file.

Workflow
--------

1.  **Initialization:** A ``TableWriter`` subclass is created with a specified target URI.
2.  **Data Preparation:** A generator is created that yields tabular data (e.g., lists, dictionaries).
3.  **Writing:** The ``write`` method of the ``TableWriter`` is called, passing the data generator.
4.  **Format Handling:** The concrete ``TableWriter`` subclass handles the specific logic for writing to the target format (e.g., Parquet or CSV).

Key Features
------------

*   **URI Handling:** The module uses URIs to represent data destinations, allowing for flexibility in specifying various targets.
*   **Generator Input:** Writers expect a generator as input, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets without loading everything into memory.
*   **Format-Specific Logic:** Each concrete writer class handles the details of writing to its specific format.
* **File Extension Detection**: The `get_writer` class method correctly creates the appropriate class based on the file extension in the target uri.

Extensibility
-------------

The module is designed to be extended:

*   **New File Types:** You can add support for new file formats by creating a new class that inherits from ``TableWriter`` and implements the ``write`` method.
*   **New Destinations:** You can support new destinations (e.g., cloud storage, databases) by creating new ``TableWriter`` subclasses that handle the specifics of writing to those destinations.

Use Cases
---------

*   **Saving ETL Results:** The module is ideal for writing the results of an ETL process to a file or set of files.
*   **Data Export:** It can be used to export data from a graph-like structure to a tabular format for analysis in other tools.
*   **Data Interchange:** It facilitates the exchange of data in standard tabular formats between different systems.
